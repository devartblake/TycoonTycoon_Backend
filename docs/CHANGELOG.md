## [2026-04-26] Store Stock System P2 — Admin Stock Management

### New endpoints (`X-Admin-Ops-Key` required)

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/admin/store/stock-policies` | List all stock policies (`?activeOnly`, `?sku`) |
| `PUT` | `/admin/store/stock-policies/{sku}` | Upsert policy — creates or updates `maxQuantityPerUser`, `resetInterval` |
| `POST` | `/admin/store/stock-policies/bulk-reset` | Reset `QuantityUsed=0` for all players on given SKU list |
| `GET` | `/admin/store/player-stock/{playerId}` | View player's per-SKU stock states including override |
| `POST` | `/admin/store/player-stock/{playerId}/override` | Set `EffectiveMaxQuantity` for a player+SKU (null clears) |
| `GET` | `/admin/store/flash-sales` | List active + scheduled flash sales |
| `POST` | `/admin/store/flash-sales` | Create flash sale (overlap guard, SKU existence check) |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/store/flash-sales/{id}` | Soft-cancel a flash sale (`IsActive=false`) |
| `GET` | `/admin/store/reward-limits/{rewardId}` | Get reward claim rule |
| `PUT` | `/admin/store/reward-limits/{rewardId}` | Upsert reward claim rule (`maxClaimsPerInterval`, `resetInterval`) |
| `GET` | `/admin/store/analytics/purchases` | Aggregate purchase stats — `totalPurchases`, `totalCoinsSpent`, `topSkus` with optional date + SKU filters |
| `GET` | `/admin/store/analytics/stock-resets` | Paginated reset history from `PlayerStoreStockState.LastResetAtUtc` |

### New entities

- **`RewardClaimRule`** — per-reward claim-frequency cap (`RewardId`, `MaxClaimsPerInterval`, `ResetInterval`, `IsActive`)
- **`EffectiveMaxQuantity`** added to `PlayerStoreStockState` — admin-controlled per-player ceiling that overrides the policy default; `null` = use policy default

### New migrations

- `20260426100000_AddRewardClaimRule` — creates `reward_claim_rules` table with unique index on `reward_id`
- `20260426110000_AddEffectiveMaxQuantity` — adds nullable `effective_max_quantity` column to `player_store_stock_states`

### Domain changes

- `PlayerStoreStockState.SetOverride(int?)` — sets/clears `EffectiveMaxQuantity`
- `PlayerStoreStockState.BulkReset(policy, now)` — admin bulk reset, respects `ResetInterval == "none"`
- `PlayerStoreStockState.GetRemaining()` — now uses `EffectiveMaxQuantity` when set, falling back to policy default
- `StoreStockPolicy.Update(maxQty, interval, isActive?)` — mutable update method for upsert path

---

## [2026-04-25] Store Stock System P0 + P1

### P0 — Daily Store + Stock Enforcement

- Added `StoreStockPolicy` domain entity (per-SKU rules: `MaxQuantityPerUser`, `ResetInterval` = "daily"/"weekly"/"none").
- Added `PlayerStoreStockState` domain entity (per-player tracking with lazy reset on `ConsumeStockAsync`).
- Added EF configurations and migration `20260425130000_AddStoreStockSystem` creating `store_stock_policies` and `player_store_stock_states` tables.
- Added `IStoreStockService` / `StoreStockService` in `Tycoon.Backend.Application/Store`:
  - `CheckStockAsync` — read-only quota check; returns `"store_item_out_of_stock"` or null.
  - `ConsumeStockAsync` — lazy reset + increment; no-ops when no policy.
  - `GetDailyItemsAsync` — returns policy-backed items enriched with player stock state.
- Added `GET /store/daily` (auth required) — daily rotating store items with remaining qty, reset time, sold-out flag.
- Extended `POST /store/purchase` — stock check before transaction; consume on success; `409 store_item_out_of_stock` when quota exhausted.
- Added `DailyStoreItemDto` + `DailyStoreResponseDto` to `Tycoon.Shared.Contracts`.

### P1 — Player-Specific Catalog + Hub + Special Offers

- Added `FlashSale` domain entity (Sku, DiscountPercent, StartsAtUtc, EndsAtUtc, IsActive, Reason).
- Added `FlashSaleConfiguration` and migration `20260425140000_AddFlashSale` creating `flash_sales` table.
- Extended `IStoreStockService` with three new methods:
  - `GetCatalogForPlayerAsync` — full catalog resolved per-player with stock state, ownership, availability state (`available`/`sold_out`/`already_owned`), stock state (`in_stock`/`low_stock`/`out_of_stock`/`unlimited`), and flash-sale discounts. All auxiliary data (policies, states, sales, ownership) loaded concurrently via `Task.WhenAll`.
  - `GetHubAsync` — featured items + daily items + category list; reuses existing methods.
  - `GetSpecialOffersAsync` — active flash sales joined with catalog items; returns sale price, original price, discount, end time.
- Added three new endpoints:
  - `GET /store/catalog/{playerId:guid}` (auth required, self-only) — player-specific catalog with optional `?itemType=` and `?category=` filters.
  - `GET /store/hub` (auth required) — store hub surface.
  - `GET /store/special-offers` (auth required) — active flash sales.
- Added `PlayerStoreCatalogItemDto`, `PlayerStoreCatalogResponseDto`, `StoreHubResponseDto`, `SpecialOfferDto`, `SpecialOffersResponseDto` to `Tycoon.Shared.Contracts`.

### Documentation

- Added `docs/store_stock_frontend_handoff_2026-04-25.md` — full frontend integration guide for all P0 + P1 store stock endpoints.
- Updated `docs/REMAINING_TASKS.md` — P0 and P1 marked complete; P2 backlog unchanged.

## [2026-04-23] MinIO Catalog Seeders + Store/Admin Store Handoff

### MinIO-backed database seeders

- Added `MinioSeeder` to `Tycoon.MigrationService` — reads JSON seed files from MinIO at startup and upserts them idempotently into the database.
- Supports four seed files: `seeds/store-items.json`, `seeds/skill-nodes.json`, `seeds/season-rewards.json`, `seeds/questions.json`.
- Missing seed files are silently skipped — only upload the files you want to seed.
- All four entity seeders follow a bulk-fetch pattern (single `WHERE IN` query per type, no N+1 loops).
- MinIO reads for all four files are issued concurrently via `Task.WhenAll` before any DB writes.
- `GetAsync(string key, CancellationToken ct)` added to `IObjectStorage` and implemented in both `MinioObjectStorage` (with `MemoryStream` callback + precise `ObjectNotFoundException`/`NoSuchKey` error guard) and `LocalObjectStorage` (file-stream from `wwwroot`).
- `EnsureBucketExistsAsync` result is cached on the singleton via a `_bucketEnsured` flag to avoid repeated network round-trips.
- `MinioSeeder` is registered as `Transient` in `MigrationService/Program.cs` and called from `MigrationWorker` with a non-fatal try/catch (MinIO unavailability is logged as a warning, not a crash).

### SeasonRewardRule persistence

- Added `DbSet<SeasonRewardRule> SeasonRewardRules` to `IAppDb` and `AppDb`.
- Added `SeasonRewardRuleConfiguration` EF entity configuration with a unique composite index on `(Tier, MaxTierRank)`.
- **Action required:** run `dotnet ef migrations add AddSeasonRewardRules --project Tycoon.Backend.Migrations --startup-project Tycoon.Backend.Api` before next deploy.

### Simplify cleanup (seeder)

- Eliminated all N+1 query patterns: bulk-fetch existing records into `Dictionary<key, entity>` before looping.
- Extracted `ApplyStoreItemFields` and `ApplyQuestionRelations` static helpers to remove field-mapping duplication.
- Questions load existing rows with `Include(q => q.Options).Include(q => q.Tags)` in a single query.
- SeasonRewardRules use a `HashSet<(int Tier, int MaxTierRank)>` for O(1) existence checks.
- Replaced stringly-typed exception filter with `IsObjectNotFoundError()` static helper (precise type-name check + stable S3 `NoSuchKey` error code).
- Added `Tycoon.Shared.Contracts` as an explicit `ProjectReference` in `Tycoon.MigrationService.csproj`.

### Documentation

- Added `docs/minio-seed-data-format.md` — JSON schema examples for all four seed file types with field notes and `mc` upload commands.
- Added `docs/store_admin_backend_handoff_2026-04-23.md` — full API contract for P0/P1/P2 store stock system and admin store endpoints.
- Updated `docs/REMAINING_TASKS.md` — avatar purchase path and MinIO seeders marked complete; SeasonRewardRule migration and store stock P0/P1/P2 backlog added as section 11.

---

## [2026-04-21] 3D Avatar Purchase Path

### New endpoints

- `GET /store/catalog?category=avatar` — avatar-specific catalog with `owned` flag per item (anonymous returns `owned: false`).
- `POST /store/avatars/{avatarId}/purchase` — buy avatar with coins; returns `{success, avatarId, coinsDeducted, newBalance}`; JWT player must match request body.
- `GET /v1/assets/avatars/{avatarId}` — returns a presigned MinIO GET URL for the `.zip` archive; owner-only.

### Storage

- Added `GetPresignedGetUrlAsync(string key, TimeSpan expiry, CancellationToken ct)` to `IPresignedStorage` and implemented in `MinioObjectStorage` with the same internal→public URL rewriting as the PUT method.

### Domain

- Added `ThumbnailUrl` (string?, max 500), `IsFeatured` (bool, default false), and `Version` (string?, max 20) to `StoreItem`.
- Added EF column mappings in `StoreItemConfig`.

### Application handlers

- `GetAvatarCatalog(Guid? PlayerId)` — queries active avatar items, optionally resolves ownership via `PlayerTransaction` aggregation.
- `PurchaseAvatar(Guid PlayerId, string AvatarId)` — validates ownership, balance, and delegates to `PlayerTransactionService`; returns structured error codes (`avatar_not_found`, `already_owned`, `insufficient_funds`).
- `GetAvatarAsset(Guid PlayerId, string AvatarId)` — validates ownership, generates 15-minute presigned GET URL for the archive.

### Shared DTOs

- Added `AvatarCatalogItemDto`, `AvatarCatalogDto`, `PurchaseAvatarRequest`, `PurchaseAvatarResultDto`, `AvatarAssetResponseDto` to `Tycoon.Shared.Contracts`.

---

## [2026-04-21] Store Catalog Premium Compatibility

### Store catalog compatibility
- Updated `GET /store/catalog` so the general catalog remains available to frontend clients even when `StoreItem` rows are not seeded.
- The endpoint still returns the existing `StoreCatalogDto` envelope.
- Active DB-backed `StoreItem` rows remain primary.
- Premium subscription fallback rows are appended from `StorePremiumOptions.AdFree.Plans` when their SKUs are not already present.
- Supported premium fallback filters now include:
  - omitted `itemType`
  - `itemType=premium`
  - `itemType=premium-subscription`
  - `itemType=subscription`
  - `itemType=ad-free`
- Unrelated catalog filters such as `itemType=powerup` do not include premium fallback rows.

### Verification
- Added Premium Store endpoint tests covering `/store/catalog` fallback behavior.
- Verified with:
  - `dotnet build Tycoon.Backend.Api\Tycoon.Backend.Api.csproj`
  - `dotnet build Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests\Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests.csproj --no-restore`
  - `dotnet test Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests\Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests.csproj --no-build --no-restore --filter PremiumStoreEndpointsTests`
- Result: `Passed (12/12)`

## [2026-04-20] Player Notifications + Direct Messaging v1

### Player notifications backend
- Added authenticated player inbox endpoints:
  - `GET /notifications/inbox`
  - `GET /notifications/unread-count`
  - `POST /notifications/{notificationId}/read`
  - `POST /notifications/read-all`
  - `DELETE /notifications/{notificationId}`
- Added a dedicated `PlayerNotification` persistence model instead of reusing admin notification history.
- Added `PlayerInboxService`-driven inbox query and mutation flow with JSON-backed payload storage.
- Wired friend-request received and friend-request accepted flows into the new player inbox.
- Added a simple system notification source by creating an inbox entry after onboarding reward claim.

### Direct messaging backend
- Added direct messaging endpoints:
  - `GET /messages/conversations`
  - `POST /messages/conversations/direct`
  - `GET /messages/conversations/{conversationId}/messages`
  - `POST /messages/conversations/{conversationId}/messages`
  - `POST /messages/conversations/{conversationId}/read`
  - `GET /messages/unread-count`
- Added dedicated persistence for:
  - `DirectMessageConversation`
  - `DirectMessageConversationParticipant`
  - `DirectMessage`
- Added `DirectMessagingService` with:
  - idempotent direct-conversation creation
  - sender-scoped `clientMessageId` idempotency
  - unread-count derivation from participant read state
  - membership enforcement for read/send/history operations

### Lightweight realtime refresh
- Extended the existing `/ws/notify` SignalR contract with refresh-style player events:
  - `NotificationInboxUpdated`
  - `DirectMessagesUpdated`
- Added SignalR notifier implementations so inbox and DM updates can trigger client refresh without introducing full live-chat transport.

### Contract hardening and test coverage
- Added focused backend tests:
  - `Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests/Notifications/PlayerNotificationsEndpointsTests.cs`
  - `Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests/Messaging/MessagesEndpointsTests.cs`
- Verified the new notifications and messaging slice on **2026-04-20** with:
  - `dotnet test Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests\Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests.csproj --no-build --no-restore --filter "PlayerNotificationsEndpointsTests|MessagesEndpointsTests"`
- Fixed two integration bugs uncovered during test pass:
  - optional pagination defaults for inbox/conversation list endpoints
  - friend-accept transaction handling under the in-memory test provider

### Documentation updates
- Rewrote `docs/notifications_backend_handoff_2026-04-20.md` to reflect the live player-inbox contract, current source integrations, realtime refresh behavior, and backend-standard error envelope.
- Rewrote `docs/messaging_backend_handoff_2026-04-20.md` to reflect the live DM contract, idempotency behavior, refresh events, and current v1 limits.
- Added and verified the relational migration for notifications and messaging:
  - `20260420231724_AddNotificationMessageing`
- Confirmed EF reports no pending model changes after the notifications/messaging migration.
- Re-ran focused backend tests:
  - `PlayerNotificationsEndpointsTests|MessagesEndpointsTests` passed `8/8`
  - `PremiumStoreEndpointsTests` passed `9/9`

## [2026-04-19] Premium Store Backend Fast-Track + Growth Planning

### Premium store backend baseline
- Added authenticated premium store endpoints:
  - `GET /store/premium`
  - `GET /store/rewards/{playerId}`
  - `POST /store/rewards/{playerId}/claim/{rewardId}`
- Premium catalog is now served from config-backed `StorePremiumOptions` with a short-lived in-memory cache.
- Reward claiming now reuses existing `PlayerTransactionService` and `PlayerWallet` infrastructure instead of introducing new persistence in v1.
- Implemented UTC-based claim windows for:
  - `daily-checkin`
  - `watch-ad`

### Premium store contract coverage
- Added typed premium store DTOs to `Tycoon.Shared.Contracts/Dtos/StoreDtos.cs`.
- Added focused contract tests in `Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests/Store/PremiumStoreEndpointsTests.cs` covering:
  - auth requirements
  - self-only reward access
  - reward-state defaults
  - daily-checkin duplicate prevention
  - watch-ad cap enforcement

### Frontend coordination docs
- Added `docs/premium_store_growth_plan_2026-04-19.md` with a multi-phase long-term growth plan for premium catalog, rewards, entitlements, analytics, and admin tooling.
- Updated `docs/premium_store_backend_handoff_2026-04-20.md` with:
  - current implementation status
  - an explicit verified route matrix for the implemented premium store endpoints
  - actual shipped DTO field names and example payloads
  - correction that the shipped error envelope is the nested backend-standard `error.code` / `error.message` shape
- Updated `docs/premium_store_growth_plan_2026-04-19.md` with a verified backend-baseline section covering the currently implemented routes and supporting subscription routes.

### Endpoint verification
- Re-ran `PremiumStoreEndpointsTests` on 2026-04-20 and confirmed the premium endpoint slice is passing:
  - `GET /store/premium`
  - `GET /store/rewards/{playerId}`
  - `POST /store/rewards/{playerId}/claim/{rewardId}`
- Re-analysis of premium-store/frontend alignment confirmed one remaining transitional gap:
  - the current frontend purchase CTA path can still request `GET /store/offers`
  - this route is not part of the implemented premium-store backend baseline

### Premium purchase-routing guidance
- Expanded premium-store documentation to give frontend a concrete backend-supported replacement for `/store/offers`:
  - `POST /store/subscription/checkout/session`
  - `POST /store/subscription/paypal/create`
  - `GET /store/subscription/status/{playerId}`
  - `POST /store/subscription/portal/session`
- Documented the current premium plan mapping for frontend routing:
  - `premium-monthly` / `sub:premium:monthly` → `tier=premium`, `billingPeriod=monthly`
  - `premium-seasonal` / `sub:premium:seasonal` → `tier=premium`, `billingPeriod=seasonal`

  - due-review sets
  - custom saved study sets

### Session and review deepening
- Study sessions now persist:
  - `Flashcard` vs `SelfTest` mode
  - ordered session question snapshots
  - explicit flashcard interaction state
  - per-question reveal/confidence/action data for resume flows
- Added persisted `StudyCardState` to support due-review recommendations beyond same-day weak-area rollups.

  - Added dynamic `userId` extraction for authenticated follow-up calls
  - Expanded request flow checks to include:
    - questions set/check
    - store catalog
    - IAP validate
    - purchase contract check (accepting expected non-2xx contract statuses)
    - crypto history
    - leaderboard read
- Enhanced `scripts/alpha-p0-smoke.ps1` with equivalent improvements:
  - `-AutoSignup` option
  - Expanded request flow pathing to mirror bash script behavior

### Documentation updates
- Updated `docs/synaptix_remaining_work.md` 6.1 section to reflect:
  - live helper scripts now cover auto-auth + fuller end-to-end path shape
  - explicit remaining requirement to run against a live API and archive evidence
- Added `docs/alpha_release_priority_2026-04-04.md` with an updated alpha-priority status and a concrete completion checklist for unresolved 6.1 tasks.
- Added `docs/frontend_backend_handoff_alpha_2026-04-04.md` for frontend integration planning aligned to completed backend capabilities and remaining gaps.

### Backend ML scorer baseline
- Added authenticated ML scoring endpoints:
  - `POST /ml/churn-risk`
  - `POST /ml/match-quality`
- Both endpoints support deployed model invocation (config-driven URL + optional bearer key) with deterministic heuristic fallback when unavailable.

## [2026-03-31] Synaptix BE Packet B — Profile Support

### BE-B1: PlayerPreferences Entity
- Created `PlayerPreferences` domain entity (`Tycoon.Backend.Domain/Entities/PlayerPreferences.cs`)
- Fields: `SynaptixMode` (kids/teen/adult), `PreferredSurface` (hub/arena/labs/pathways/journey/circles/command), `ReducedMotion` (bool), `TonePreference` (playful/balanced/competitive)
- One row per player, created on first PUT
- Sensible defaults: adult mode, hub surface, no reduced motion, balanced tone

### BE-B2: EF Core Persistence
- Created `PlayerPreferencesConfiguration` with unique index on `PlayerId` and max-length constraints
- Added `DbSet<PlayerPreferences>` to `AppDb` and `IAppDb`

### BE-B3: DTOs
- Created `PlayerPreferencesDto` (read) and `UpdatePlayerPreferencesRequest` (write) records
- Update request uses nullable fields — only provided fields are changed (partial update)

### BE-B4: API Endpoints
- `GET /users/me/preferences` — returns current preferences (defaults if none set)
- `PUT /users/me/preferences` — upserts preferences with input validation
- Validates allowed values for mode, surface, and tone
- Requires authorization (uses `ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier`)
- Registered in `Program.cs`

**What was NOT changed (by design)**:
- No existing profile fields or endpoints modified
- No existing profile endpoint paths changed
- No new migrations generated (requires `dotnet ef` in a build environment)

---

## [2026-03-31] Synaptix BE Packet D — Analytics & Stabilization (continued)

### BE-D1: Remaining Analytics Dimensions
- Added `EntryPoint` and `BrandVersion` nullable fields to all 3 analytics models
- Added JSON extraction for `entryPoint`, `brandVersion` in `AnalyticsEndpoints.cs`
- Added `.Keyword("entryPoint")`, `.Keyword("brandVersion")` to both Elasticsearch index templates
- Bumped both template versions to 3
- All 5 planned Synaptix dimensions now complete: `SynaptixMode`, `Surface`, `AudienceSegment`, `EntryPoint`, `BrandVersion`

### BE-C5: Analytics/Admin Terminology Alignment

**Blazor Operator Dashboard** (`Tycoon.OperatorDashboard/`):
- `Events.razor`: "Entry Fee (coins)" → "(Credits)", "Revive Cost (gems)" → "(Synapse Shards)"
- `Economy.razor`: Wallet labels "Coins" → "Credits", "XP" → "Neural XP"
- `Economy.razor`: Grant currency dropdown "Coins" → "Credits", "XP" → "Neural XP"

**Vue Operator Dashboard** (`Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Vue/`):
- `economy.vue`: Table headers "XP" → "Neural XP", "Coins" → "Credits"
- `economy.vue`: Form labels "XP Delta" → "Neural XP Delta", "Coins Delta" → "Credits Delta"
- `economy.vue`: Transaction/rollback balance messages updated
- `users/[id].vue`: Currency labels "XP" → "Neural XP", "Coins" → "Credits"

**Web/React Operator Dashboard** (`Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Web/`):
- `EconomyView.tsx`: Currency label map "XP" → "Neural XP", "Coins" → "Credits"
- `EconomyView.tsx`: Form field labels and balance messages updated
- `UserDetailView.tsx`: Currency labels "XP" → "Neural XP", "Coins" → "Credits"

**What was NOT changed (by design)**:
- "Social Accounts" in account-settings — refers to OAuth integrations (Google, Twitter), not Synaptix Circles
- "Diamonds" — kept as-is per terminology reference (no Synaptix rename defined)
- API property names (`balanceCoins`, `balanceXp`, etc.) — contract stability
- Enum values (`CurrencyType.Coins`, etc.) — technical identifiers

---

## [2026-03-29] Synaptix BE Packet D — Analytics & Stabilization

### BE-D1: Analytics Dimensions (Phase 6)

**Analytics Models** (`Tycoon.Backend.Application/Analytics/Models/`):
- Added nullable Synaptix dimensions to `QuestionAnsweredAnalyticsEvent.cs`: `SynaptixMode`, `Surface`, `AudienceSegment`
- Added same dimensions to `QuestionAnsweredDailyRollup.cs` and `QuestionAnsweredPlayerDailyRollup.cs`
- `UpdateFrom()` already copies the new fields during upsert operations

**Analytics Endpoint** (`Tycoon.Backend.Api/Features/Analytics/AnalyticsEndpoints.cs`):
- Added JSON extraction for `synaptixMode`, `surface`, `audienceSegment` in `TryMapQuestionAnsweredEvent()`
- Fields are optional — omitting them leaves null values (backward compatible)

**Elasticsearch Templates** (`Tycoon.Backend.Infrastructure/Analytics/Elastic/ElasticAdmin.cs`):
- Added `.Keyword("synaptixMode")`, `.Keyword("surface")`, `.Keyword("audienceSegment")` to daily rollup template
- Added same fields to player daily rollup template
- Bumped both template versions to 2

**Writers (no changes needed)**:
- `PostgresAnalyticsEventWriter` uses EF Core `SetValues()`/`UpdateFrom()` — handles new fields automatically
- `MongoAnalyticsEventWriter` uses BSON serialization — handles new nullable fields automatically

### BE-D2: Stabilization (Phase 7)
- Verified Swagger titles/descriptions read as "Synaptix API"
- Verified all 3 operator dashboards (Blazor, Vue, Web) display "Synaptix Command"
- Verified no remaining "Tycoon Ops" or "Trivia Tycoon" in operator-visible UI text
- Technical identifiers (`Tycoon.Backend.*` namespaces, cookie keys, container labels) intentionally preserved — deferred to Packet E

### Separated Migration Plans
- Created `docs/synaptix_frontend_plan.md` — self-contained Flutter app migration plan (FE Packets A–E)
- Created `docs/synaptix_backend_plan.md` — self-contained backend migration plan (BE Packets A–E)

### What was NOT changed (by design)
- `Tycoon.Backend.*` / `Tycoon.Shared.*` namespaces
- Project names and .csproj files
- Endpoint paths and DTO field names
- JWT issuer/audience (`TycoonBackendApi` / `TycoonFrontendApp`)
- Database names, table names, migration identifiers
- gRPC proto package (`tycoon.sidecar`)
- Observability service name (`Tycoon.Backend.Api`)
- CI/CD pipeline names, Docker image names
- Cookie/persistence keys (`tycoon-ops-dashboard`)

## [2026-03-28] Durable Sidecar Inference Path in Compose

- Updated `docker/compose.yml` backend service to mount persistent volume `sidecar_inference_data` at `/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar`.
- Added `SIDECAR_INFERENCE_STORE_PATH=/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar/inference-store.jsonl` so the file-backed inference store persists across backend container restarts.
- Updated README sidecar gRPC status section to reflect that file-backed inference storage is now the default baseline.

---

## [2026-03-28] Health Pass Automation Script

- Added `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` to execute the SEQ-5 command checklist and regenerate `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` in a consistent format.
- Added fallback execution mode for dotnet-dependent commands using `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0` when local `dotnet` is unavailable but Docker is installed.
- Added CI workflow job `health-pass-report` to execute `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` and upload `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` as a workflow artifact.
- Added health-pass command log output under `artifacts/health-pass/` and CI upload of that folder as `project-health-pass-logs`.
- Improved health-pass blocker notes to surface the most actionable missing-tool error line (instead of generic script preamble lines).
- Added CI job `grpc-streaming-tests` to run the new Sidecar/Mobile gRPC-focused test suites as a dedicated validation stage.
- Ran the script in this environment:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` passed
  - `dotnet`/`docker` dependent checks remained blocked due to missing local tooling

---

## [2026-03-28] Admin Questions 500 Follow-up + Plan Status Refresh

### Backend query hardening
- Updated `AdminListQuestions` paging query to avoid nested tag-list materialization inside the SQL projection path.
- Switched to two-step retrieval (paged rows + page-scoped tag dictionary) to reduce provider translation/runtime fragility that manifested as repeated dashboard 500 retries on `/admin/questions`.

### Planning/status updates
- Refreshed checklist and health-report status to reflect current SEQ-5 state:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` re-run and passing
  - EF schema validation still blocked by missing `dotnet` CLI in this environment
  - Health report exists and tracks blockers plus follow-up actions

---

## [2026-03-28] gRPC Checklist Progress + Health Report Refresh

### gRPC debt-tracking docs
- Marked SEQ-3 and SEQ-4 issue checklists as complete in `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` after adding gRPC coverage for sidecar and mobile streaming behavior.
- Added explicit progress note for `MobileMatchGrpcServiceTests` covering answer-result/running-score and live leaderboard stream behavior.
- Updated `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` to reflect expanded test coverage and clarify that execution is pending environment/tool availability.

### Health pass refresh
- Refreshed `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` date and latest run notes.
- Re-ran shell health checks:
  - `bash scripts/check-error-envelope-hardening.sh` ✅ pass
  - `bash scripts/validate-ef-schema.sh` ❌ blocked (`dotnet: command not found`)

---

## [2026-03-27] Sidecar gRPC Wiring + Dashboard Build Path Clarification

### Sidecar gRPC
- `SidecarGrpcService` now wires concrete paths for:
  - `ReportAnalyticsEvent` / `StreamAnalyticsEvents` (supports `question_answered` payload mapping + persistence via `IAnalyticsEventWriter`)
  - `SubmitInferenceResult` (stores through `ISidecarInferenceStore`)
  - `TriggerBackendAction` (supports `admin_event_queue_reprocess` via MediatR command dispatch with deterministic errors for unsupported/invalid actions)
- Added `ISidecarInferenceStore` + `InMemorySidecarInferenceStore` and DI registration in API startup.

### Mobile gRPC
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.WatchLeaderboard` now builds live snapshots via MediatR (`GetMyTier` + `GetTierLeaderboard`) instead of static placeholder snapshot generation.
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.PlayMatch` now evaluates submitted answers against persisted question answer keys and emits live running score / correct-count updates per participant.
- Added `EvaluateMatchAnswer` MediatR handler in application layer and initial `MatchSession` tests for score progression + stream fan-out behavior.

### Dashboard build source-of-truth
- Blazor operator dashboard remains authoritative in compose (`docker/Dockerfile.dashboard`).
- Alternate Next.js dashboard Dockerfiles are preserved as archived `.txt` artifacts to avoid accidental default build-path drift.

### Docs / planning updates
- README includes sidecar gRPC “current status” contract notes.
- `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` marks SEQ-1/SEQ-2 complete and SEQ-3 in progress.
- `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` now tracks Workstream 1 subtasks with completion state.

- Added health-pass command log output under `artifacts/health-pass/` and CI upload of that folder as `project-health-pass-logs`.
- Improved health-pass blocker notes to surface the most actionable missing-tool error line (instead of generic script preamble lines).
- Added CI job `grpc-streaming-tests` to run the new Sidecar/Mobile gRPC-focused test suites as a dedicated validation stage.
- Ran the script in this environment:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` passed
  - `dotnet`/`docker` dependent checks remained blocked due to missing local tooling

## [2026-03-28] Admin Questions 500 Follow-up + Plan Status Refresh

### Backend query hardening
- Updated `AdminListQuestions` paging query to avoid nested tag-list materialization inside the SQL projection path.
- Switched to two-step retrieval (paged rows + page-scoped tag dictionary) to reduce provider translation/runtime fragility that manifested as repeated dashboard 500 retries on `/admin/questions`.

### Planning/status updates
- Refreshed checklist and health-report status to reflect current SEQ-5 state:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` re-run and passing
  - EF schema validation still blocked by missing `dotnet` CLI in this environment
  - Health report exists and tracks blockers plus follow-up actions

---

## [2026-03-28] gRPC Checklist Progress + Health Report Refresh

### gRPC debt-tracking docs
- Marked SEQ-3 and SEQ-4 issue checklists as complete in `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` after adding gRPC coverage for sidecar and mobile streaming behavior.
- Added explicit progress note for `MobileMatchGrpcServiceTests` covering answer-result/running-score and live leaderboard stream behavior.
- Updated `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` to reflect expanded test coverage and clarify that execution is pending environment/tool availability.

### Health pass refresh
- Refreshed `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` date and latest run notes.
- Re-ran shell health checks:
  - `bash scripts/check-error-envelope-hardening.sh` ✅ pass
  - `bash scripts/validate-ef-schema.sh` ❌ blocked (`dotnet: command not found`)

---

## [2026-03-27] Sidecar gRPC Wiring + Dashboard Build Path Clarification

### Sidecar gRPC
- `SidecarGrpcService` now wires concrete paths for:
  - `ReportAnalyticsEvent` / `StreamAnalyticsEvents` (supports `question_answered` payload mapping + persistence via `IAnalyticsEventWriter`)
  - `SubmitInferenceResult` (stores through `ISidecarInferenceStore`)
  - `TriggerBackendAction` (supports `admin_event_queue_reprocess` via MediatR command dispatch with deterministic errors for unsupported/invalid actions)
- Added `ISidecarInferenceStore` + `InMemorySidecarInferenceStore` and DI registration in API startup.

### Mobile gRPC
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.WatchLeaderboard` now builds live snapshots via MediatR (`GetMyTier` + `GetTierLeaderboard`) instead of static placeholder snapshot generation.
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.PlayMatch` now evaluates submitted answers against persisted question answer keys and emits live running score / correct-count updates per participant.
- Added `EvaluateMatchAnswer` MediatR handler in application layer and initial `MatchSession` tests for score progression + stream fan-out behavior.

### Dashboard build source-of-truth
- Blazor operator dashboard remains authoritative in compose (`docker/Dockerfile.dashboard`).
- Alternate Next.js dashboard Dockerfiles are preserved as archived `.txt` artifacts to avoid accidental default build-path drift.

### Docs / planning updates
- README includes sidecar gRPC “current status” contract notes.
- `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` marks SEQ-1/SEQ-2 complete and SEQ-3 in progress.
- `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` now tracks Workstream 1 subtasks with completion state.

---

## [2026-03-28] Durable Sidecar Inference Path in Compose

- Updated `docker/compose.yml` backend service to mount persistent volume `sidecar_inference_data` at `/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar`.
- Added `SIDECAR_INFERENCE_STORE_PATH=/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar/inference-store.jsonl` so the file-backed inference store persists across backend container restarts.
- Updated README sidecar gRPC status section to reflect that file-backed inference storage is now the default baseline.

  - `SubmitInferenceResult` (stores through `ISidecarInferenceStore`)
  - `TriggerBackendAction` (supports `admin_event_queue_reprocess` via MediatR command dispatch with deterministic errors for unsupported/invalid actions)
- Added `ISidecarInferenceStore` + `InMemorySidecarInferenceStore` and DI registration in API startup.

### Mobile gRPC
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.WatchLeaderboard` now builds live snapshots via MediatR (`GetMyTier` + `GetTierLeaderboard`) instead of static placeholder snapshot generation.
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.PlayMatch` now evaluates submitted answers against persisted question answer keys and emits live running score / correct-count updates per participant.
- Added `EvaluateMatchAnswer` MediatR handler in application layer and initial `MatchSession` tests for score progression + stream fan-out behavior.

### Dashboard build source-of-truth
- Blazor operator dashboard remains authoritative in compose (`docker/Dockerfile.dashboard`).
- Alternate Next.js dashboard Dockerfiles are preserved as archived `.txt` artifacts to avoid accidental default build-path drift.

### Docs / planning updates
- README includes sidecar gRPC “current status” contract notes.
- `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` marks SEQ-1/SEQ-2 complete and SEQ-3 in progress.
- `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` now tracks Workstream 1 subtasks with completion state.

## [2026-03-28] Durable Sidecar Inference Path in Compose

- Updated `docker/compose.yml` backend service to mount persistent volume `sidecar_inference_data` at `/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar`.
- Added `SIDECAR_INFERENCE_STORE_PATH=/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar/inference-store.jsonl` so the file-backed inference store persists across backend container restarts.
- Updated README sidecar gRPC status section to reflect that file-backed inference storage is now the default baseline.

---

## [2026-03-28] Health Pass Automation Script

- Added `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` to execute the SEQ-5 command checklist and regenerate `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` in a consistent format.
- Added fallback execution mode for dotnet-dependent commands using `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0` when local `dotnet` is unavailable but Docker is installed.
- Added CI workflow job `health-pass-report` to execute `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` and upload `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` as a workflow artifact.
- Added health-pass command log output under `artifacts/health-pass/` and CI upload of that folder as `project-health-pass-logs`.
- Improved health-pass blocker notes to surface the most actionable missing-tool error line (instead of generic script preamble lines).
- Added CI job `grpc-streaming-tests` to run the new Sidecar/Mobile gRPC-focused test suites as a dedicated validation stage.
- Ran the script in this environment:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` passed
  - `dotnet`/`docker` dependent checks remained blocked due to missing local tooling

## [2026-03-28] Admin Questions 500 Follow-up + Plan Status Refresh

### Backend query hardening
- Updated `AdminListQuestions` paging query to avoid nested tag-list materialization inside the SQL projection path.
- Switched to two-step retrieval (paged rows + page-scoped tag dictionary) to reduce provider translation/runtime fragility that manifested as repeated dashboard 500 retries on `/admin/questions`.

### Planning/status updates
- Refreshed checklist and health-report status to reflect current SEQ-5 state:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` re-run and passing
  - EF schema validation still blocked by missing `dotnet` CLI in this environment
  - Health report exists and tracks blockers plus follow-up actions

## [2026-03-28] gRPC Checklist Progress + Health Report Refresh

### gRPC debt-tracking docs
- Marked SEQ-3 and SEQ-4 issue checklists as complete in `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` after adding gRPC coverage for sidecar and mobile streaming behavior.
- Added explicit progress note for `MobileMatchGrpcServiceTests` covering answer-result/running-score and live leaderboard stream behavior.
- Updated `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` to reflect expanded test coverage and clarify that execution is pending environment/tool availability.

### Health pass refresh
- Refreshed `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` date and latest run notes.
- Re-ran shell health checks:
  - `bash scripts/check-error-envelope-hardening.sh` ✅ pass
  - `bash scripts/validate-ef-schema.sh` ❌ blocked (`dotnet: command not found`)

- Added CI job `grpc-streaming-tests` to run the new Sidecar/Mobile gRPC-focused test suites as a dedicated validation stage.
- Ran the script in this environment:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` passed
  - `dotnet`/`docker` dependent checks remained blocked due to missing local tooling

## [2026-03-28] Admin Questions 500 Follow-up + Plan Status Refresh

### Backend query hardening
- Updated `AdminListQuestions` paging query to avoid nested tag-list materialization inside the SQL projection path.
- Switched to two-step retrieval (paged rows + page-scoped tag dictionary) to reduce provider translation/runtime fragility that manifested as repeated dashboard 500 retries on `/admin/questions`.

### Planning/status updates
- Refreshed checklist and health-report status to reflect current SEQ-5 state:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` re-run and passing
  - EF schema validation still blocked by missing `dotnet` CLI in this environment
  - Health report exists and tracks blockers plus follow-up actions

---

## [2026-03-28] gRPC Checklist Progress + Health Report Refresh

### gRPC debt-tracking docs
- Marked SEQ-3 and SEQ-4 issue checklists as complete in `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` after adding gRPC coverage for sidecar and mobile streaming behavior.
- Added explicit progress note for `MobileMatchGrpcServiceTests` covering answer-result/running-score and live leaderboard stream behavior.
- Updated `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` to reflect expanded test coverage and clarify that execution is pending environment/tool availability.

### Health pass refresh
- Refreshed `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` date and latest run notes.
- Re-ran shell health checks:
  - `bash scripts/check-error-envelope-hardening.sh` ✅ pass
  - `bash scripts/validate-ef-schema.sh` ❌ blocked (`dotnet: command not found`)

---

## [2026-03-27] Sidecar gRPC Wiring + Dashboard Build Path Clarification

### Sidecar gRPC
- `SidecarGrpcService` now wires concrete paths for:
  - `ReportAnalyticsEvent` / `StreamAnalyticsEvents` (supports `question_answered` payload mapping + persistence via `IAnalyticsEventWriter`)
  - `SubmitInferenceResult` (stores through `ISidecarInferenceStore`)
  - `TriggerBackendAction` (supports `admin_event_queue_reprocess` via MediatR command dispatch with deterministic errors for unsupported/invalid actions)
- Added `ISidecarInferenceStore` + `InMemorySidecarInferenceStore` and DI registration in API startup.

### Mobile gRPC
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.WatchLeaderboard` now builds live snapshots via MediatR (`GetMyTier` + `GetTierLeaderboard`) instead of static placeholder snapshot generation.
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.PlayMatch` now evaluates submitted answers against persisted question answer keys and emits live running score / correct-count updates per participant.
- Added `EvaluateMatchAnswer` MediatR handler in application layer and initial `MatchSession` tests for score progression + stream fan-out behavior.

### Dashboard build source-of-truth
- Blazor operator dashboard remains authoritative in compose (`docker/Dockerfile.dashboard`).
- Alternate Next.js dashboard Dockerfiles are preserved as archived `.txt` artifacts to avoid accidental default build-path drift.

### Docs / planning updates
- README includes sidecar gRPC “current status” contract notes.
- `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` marks SEQ-1/SEQ-2 complete and SEQ-3 in progress.
- `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` now tracks Workstream 1 subtasks with completion state.

## [2026-04-04] Operator Dashboard Migration Progress (Wave A Foundations)

- Added Vue Wave A shared API client conventions:
  - `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Vue/src/lib/apiClient.js`
  - `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Vue/src/api/dashboard.js`
  - `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Vue/src/api/auditLog.js`
  - `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Vue/src/api/users.js`
- Upgraded Vue Wave A views (`DashboardView`, `AuditLogView`, `UsersView`) from static placeholders to API-backed loading/error/data states.
- Wired Vue router guard to `/api/me` session bootstrap (`src/lib/session.js`) instead of hardcoded permissions.
- Expanded Web BFF bootstrap with:
  - Typed Wave A endpoints (`/api/dashboard/overview`, `/api/audit-log`, `/api/users`)
  - Header-based session/bootstrap middleware (`X-Operator-User`, `X-Operator-Permissions`) for migration environments.
  - Structured upstream error normalization for non-JSON backend errors and timeout/unreachable handling in `ProxyToBackend`.
- Updated migration status docs (`docs/OPERATOR_DASHBOARD_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`, Vue README, Web README) with a dated status snapshot and next-step checklist.
- Replaced Wave A JSON `<pre>` placeholders for Audit Log and Users with API-backed table + paging views.
- Replaced Dashboard Wave A JSON placeholder with KPI-style metric cards bound to overview payload values.
- Added initial Wave A query/filter wiring: Audit Log status filter and Users search/isBanned filters.
- Added initial Wave A user action workflow: Users ban/unban actions wired from Vue to Web BFF routes.
- Added initial Wave A action UX polish: operator-provided ban reason and per-row in-flight action state in Users view.
- Re-ran `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` and refreshed `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` for 2026-04-04; current environment still blocks `dotnet` and `docker` commands while error-envelope check passes.
- Fixed `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` report generation so the "setup prerequisites" command is rendered as literal markdown instead of being executed during report creation.

---

## [2026-03-28] Durable Sidecar Inference Path in Compose

- Updated `docker/compose.yml` backend service to mount persistent volume `sidecar_inference_data` at `/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar`.
- Added `SIDECAR_INFERENCE_STORE_PATH=/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar/inference-store.jsonl` so the file-backed inference store persists across backend container restarts.
- Updated README sidecar gRPC status section to reflect that file-backed inference storage is now the default baseline.

- `MobileMatchGrpcService.PlayMatch` now evaluates submitted answers against persisted question answer keys and emits live running score / correct-count updates per participant.
- Added `EvaluateMatchAnswer` MediatR handler in application layer and initial `MatchSession` tests for score progression + stream fan-out behavior.

### Dashboard build source-of-truth
- Blazor operator dashboard remains authoritative in compose (`docker/Dockerfile.dashboard`).
- Alternate Next.js dashboard Dockerfiles are preserved as archived `.txt` artifacts to avoid accidental default build-path drift.

### Docs / planning updates
- README includes sidecar gRPC “current status” contract notes.
- `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` marks SEQ-1/SEQ-2 complete and SEQ-3 in progress.
- `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` now tracks Workstream 1 subtasks with completion state.

## [2026-04-04] Operator Dashboard Migration Progress (Wave A Foundations)

- Added Vue Wave A shared API client conventions:
  - `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Vue/src/lib/apiClient.js`
  - `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Vue/src/api/dashboard.js`
  - `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Vue/src/api/auditLog.js`
  - `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Vue/src/api/users.js`
- Upgraded Vue Wave A views (`DashboardView`, `AuditLogView`, `UsersView`) from static placeholders to API-backed loading/error/data states.
- Wired Vue router guard to `/api/me` session bootstrap (`src/lib/session.js`) instead of hardcoded permissions.
- Expanded Web BFF bootstrap with:
  - Typed Wave A endpoints (`/api/dashboard/overview`, `/api/audit-log`, `/api/users`)
  - Header-based session/bootstrap middleware (`X-Operator-User`, `X-Operator-Permissions`) for migration environments.
  - Structured upstream error normalization for non-JSON backend errors and timeout/unreachable handling in `ProxyToBackend`.
- Updated migration status docs (`docs/OPERATOR_DASHBOARD_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`, Vue README, Web README) with a dated status snapshot and next-step checklist.
- Replaced Wave A JSON `<pre>` placeholders for Audit Log and Users with API-backed table + paging views.
- Replaced Dashboard Wave A JSON placeholder with KPI-style metric cards bound to overview payload values.
- Added initial Wave A query/filter wiring: Audit Log status filter and Users search/isBanned filters.
- Added initial Wave A user action workflow: Users ban/unban actions wired from Vue to Web BFF routes.
- Added initial Wave A action UX polish: operator-provided ban reason and per-row in-flight action state in Users view.
- Re-ran `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` and refreshed `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` for 2026-04-04; current environment still blocks `dotnet` and `docker` commands while error-envelope check passes.
- Fixed `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` report generation so the "setup prerequisites" command is rendered as literal markdown instead of being executed during report creation.
- Added Vue dashboard `npm run build:icons` placeholder script and documented it in the Vue README so legacy Docker build flows that invoke this script no longer fail with "Missing script: build:icons".
- Fixed `AdminListQuestions` list-item DTO mapping by passing `MediaKey` explicitly and aligning `QuestionListItemDto` contract shape with downstream compile expectations (`UpdatedAtUtc` remains the final required argument).
- Added explicit `builder.Services.AddHttpClient()` in backend API startup to ensure `IHttpClientFactory` can be inferred as a service dependency for minimal-API handlers and prevent startup failure on unresolved `httpClientFactory` parameters.
- Sidecar Elasticsearch compatibility hardening: pinned `elasticsearch[async]` to `<9.0` and added explicit compatibility headers (`compatible-with=8` by default) so rebalance metrics sink indexing does not fail against Elasticsearch 8 clusters with media-type version mismatch.

---

## [2026-03-28] Durable Sidecar Inference Path in Compose

- Updated `docker/compose.yml` backend service to mount persistent volume `sidecar_inference_data` at `/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar`.
- Added `SIDECAR_INFERENCE_STORE_PATH=/var/lib/tycoon-sidecar/inference-store.jsonl` so the file-backed inference store persists across backend container restarts.
- Updated README sidecar gRPC status section to reflect that file-backed inference storage is now the default baseline.

---

## [2026-03-28] Health Pass Automation Script

- Added `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` to execute the SEQ-5 command checklist and regenerate `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` in a consistent format.
- Added fallback execution mode for dotnet-dependent commands using `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0` when local `dotnet` is unavailable but Docker is installed.
- Added CI workflow job `health-pass-report` to execute `scripts/run-health-pass.sh` and upload `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` as a workflow artifact.
- Added health-pass command log output under `artifacts/health-pass/` and CI upload of that folder as `project-health-pass-logs`.
- Improved health-pass blocker notes to surface the most actionable missing-tool error line (instead of generic script preamble lines).
- Added CI job `grpc-streaming-tests` to run the new Sidecar/Mobile gRPC-focused test suites as a dedicated validation stage.
- Ran the script in this environment:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` passed
  - `dotnet`/`docker` dependent checks remained blocked due to missing local tooling

---

## [2026-03-28] Admin Questions 500 Follow-up + Plan Status Refresh

### Backend query hardening
- Updated `AdminListQuestions` paging query to avoid nested tag-list materialization inside the SQL projection path.
- Switched to two-step retrieval (paged rows + page-scoped tag dictionary) to reduce provider translation/runtime fragility that manifested as repeated dashboard 500 retries on `/admin/questions`.

### Planning/status updates
- Refreshed checklist and health-report status to reflect current SEQ-5 state:
  - `check-error-envelope-hardening` re-run and passing
  - EF schema validation still blocked by missing `dotnet` CLI in this environment
  - Health report exists and tracks blockers plus follow-up actions

---

## [2026-03-28] gRPC Checklist Progress + Health Report Refresh

### gRPC debt-tracking docs
- Marked SEQ-3 and SEQ-4 issue checklists as complete in `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` after adding gRPC coverage for sidecar and mobile streaming behavior.
- Added explicit progress note for `MobileMatchGrpcServiceTests` covering answer-result/running-score and live leaderboard stream behavior.
- Updated `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` to reflect expanded test coverage and clarify that execution is pending environment/tool availability.

### Health pass refresh
- Refreshed `docs/PROJECT_HEALTH_REPORT.md` date and latest run notes.
- Re-ran shell health checks:
  - `bash scripts/check-error-envelope-hardening.sh` ✅ pass
  - `bash scripts/validate-ef-schema.sh` ❌ blocked (`dotnet: command not found`)

---

## [2026-03-27] Sidecar gRPC Wiring + Dashboard Build Path Clarification

### Sidecar gRPC
- `SidecarGrpcService` now wires concrete paths for:
  - `ReportAnalyticsEvent` / `StreamAnalyticsEvents` (supports `question_answered` payload mapping + persistence via `IAnalyticsEventWriter`)
  - `SubmitInferenceResult` (stores through `ISidecarInferenceStore`)
  - `TriggerBackendAction` (supports `admin_event_queue_reprocess` via MediatR command dispatch with deterministic errors for unsupported/invalid actions)
- Added `ISidecarInferenceStore` + `InMemorySidecarInferenceStore` and DI registration in API startup.

### Mobile gRPC
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.WatchLeaderboard` now builds live snapshots via MediatR (`GetMyTier` + `GetTierLeaderboard`) instead of static placeholder snapshot generation.
- `MobileMatchGrpcService.PlayMatch` now evaluates submitted answers against persisted question answer keys and emits live running score / correct-count updates per participant.
- Added `EvaluateMatchAnswer` MediatR handler in application layer and initial `MatchSession` tests for score progression + stream fan-out behavior.

### Dashboard build source-of-truth
- Blazor operator dashboard remains authoritative in compose (`docker/Dockerfile.dashboard`).
- Alternate Next.js dashboard Dockerfiles are preserved as archived `.txt` artifacts to avoid accidental default build-path drift.

### Docs / planning updates
- README includes sidecar gRPC “current status” contract notes.
- `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md` marks SEQ-1/SEQ-2 complete and SEQ-3 in progress.
- `docs/GRPC_TECH_DEBT_NEXT_STEPS.md` now tracks Workstream 1 subtasks with completion state.

---

## [2026-03-17] Operator Dashboard + FastAPI Sidecar

Adds two new services to the solution:

### `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard` — Blazor Server operator control panel
- Browser UI for the ops team — no more Swagger/Postman for day-to-day operations
- **Pages:** Dashboard, Seasons (activate/close), Game Events (open/close), Feature Flags (toggle on/off), Users (ban/unban), Moderation (escalation list), Economy (overview)
- Authenticates against `/admin/auth/login`; JWT stored server-side (`TokenStore`) — never sent to the browser
- Typed `AdminApiClient` wraps all admin REST endpoints; attaches `Authorization: Bearer` + `X-Admin-Ops-Key` header
- Registered in `Tycoon.AppHost` with Aspire service discovery (`WithReference(api)`)
- Docker: `docker/Dockerfile.dashboard`, exposed on port `8200`

### `Tycoon.Sidecar` — FastAPI Python service
- `/ml` — match quality scoring, churn risk prediction, question difficulty estimation
- `/analytics` — season KPIs, event funnel, D1/D7/D30 retention (wire up Motor/Elasticsearch)
- `/webhooks` — Stripe payments, generic signed webhooks, push notification proxy
- `/utilities` — season snapshot to MongoDB, bulk question import, backend health probe
- Registered in `Tycoon.AppHost` via `AddExecutable("tycoon-sidecar", "uvicorn", ...)` on port `8100`
- Docker: `docker/Dockerfile.sidecar`, exposed on port `8100`

### Infrastructure changes
- `Tycoon.AppHost/Program.cs` — registers `tycoon-dashboard` and `tycoon-sidecar`
- `docker/compose.yml` — adds `sidecar` and `operator-dashboard` services
- `TycoonTycoon_Backend.slnx` — `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard` added under `/Hosting/`

---

## [2026-03-16] Feature Flag Activation Controls (Part A)

Adds runtime on/off toggles for the three game modes (Game Events, Guardians, Territory) without requiring Hangfire dashboard access or redeployment.

### New Service: `FeatureFlagService`
- **File:** `Tycoon.Backend.Application/Config/FeatureFlagService.cs`
- Scoped per-request; lazy-loads `AdminAppConfig.FeatureFlagsJson` once per scope
- Missing keys default to `true` (safe for zero-downtime rollouts)
- Constants: `GameEventsEnabled = "game_events_enabled"`, `GuardianEnabled = "guardian_enabled"`, `TerritoryEnabled = "territory_enabled"`

### Guards Added
| Component | Flag checked | Early-return status |
|---|---|---|
| `GameEventSchedulerJob` (Hangfire) | `game_events_enabled` | Skips entire job |
| `EnterGameEvent` handler | `game_events_enabled` | `"FeatureDisabled"` → HTTP 503 |
| `ChallengeGuardian` handler | `guardian_enabled` | `"FeatureDisabled"` → HTTP 503 |
| `GuardianAssignmentJob` (Hangfire) | `guardian_enabled` | Skips entire job |
| `StartTerritoryDuel` handler | `territory_enabled` | `"FeatureDisabled"` → HTTP 503 |

### API Layer Changes
- `GameEventsEndpoints` — `"FeatureDisabled"` mapped to HTTP 503
- `GuardiansEndpoints` — `"FeatureDisabled"` mapped to HTTP 503
- `TerritoryEndpoints` — `"FeatureDisabled"` mapped to HTTP 503

### Admin Config Defaults
- `AdminConfigEndpoints.GetOrCreate()` now seeds `game_events_enabled=true`, `guardian_enabled=true`, `territory_enabled=true` on first startup

### How to toggle
```http
PATCH /admin/config
Content-Type: application/json

{ "featureFlags": { "game_events_enabled": false } }
```

## [2026-03-16] Flutter Frontend Integration Guide

- Created `docs/FLUTTER_INTEGRATION.md` — authoritative Flutter client reference covering:
  - Project setup (recommended packages: `dio`, `signalr_netcore`, `flutter_secure_storage`)
  - Full authentication flow: signup, login, token refresh, secure storage, Dio interceptor
  - Complete REST API reference for all non-admin endpoints grouped by feature
  - Real-time (SignalR) hub setup, group subscriptions, and all 6 server-push event payloads with payload shapes
  - End-to-end feature flows: Game Event battle royale, Guardian Challenge, Territory Capture, Ranked Match
  - Event system activation controls (how seasons and game events are turned on/off, including the gap: no global toggle)
  - Error handling patterns: HTTP codes, domain status strings, recommended Dart error model
  - Rate limit reference table

---

## [2026-03-16] Game Event Tracking System

Adds a separate event analytics layer covering the GameEvent, Guardian, and Territory game modes. Deliberately **not** mixed with the ranked-ladder (`PlayerSeasonProfile` / `LeaderboardEntry`) so tier assignment is never distorted.

### New Entity: `PlayerEventStats`
- **File:** `Tycoon.Backend.Domain/Entities/PlayerEventStats.cs`
- One row per player-season; updated incrementally (no batch recompute job needed)
- Fields:
  - **GameEvent** — `EventsEntered`, `EventsTop20`, `EventsWon`, `TotalEventXpEarned`, `TotalEventCoinsEarned`, `ChampionBattleEliminations`
  - **Guardian** — `GuardianPromotions`, `GuardianDefencesWon`, `GuardianDefencesLost`, `GuardianDaysTotal`
  - **Territory** — `TilesEverCaptured`, `CurrentTilesOwned`, `PeakXpMultiplierBps`

### EF Infrastructure
- **`PlayerEventStatsConfiguration`** — `player_event_stats` table; unique index on `(SeasonId, PlayerId)`; composite indexes on `(SeasonId, EventsWon)`, `(SeasonId, GuardianDefencesWon)`, `(SeasonId, CurrentTilesOwned)`
- **`IAppDb` / `AppDb`** — `DbSet<PlayerEventStats> PlayerEventStats`
- **Migration `20260315000000_AddPlayerEventStats`** — `CREATE TABLE player_event_stats` with all columns and indexes

### New Service: `PlayerEventStatsService`
- **File:** `Tycoon.Backend.Application/EventStats/PlayerEventStatsService.cs`
- `GetOrCreateAsync(seasonId, playerId, ct)` — upsert helper used by all hooks

### New Query Handlers (`Application/EventStats/`)
| Handler | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `GetGameEventLeaderboard(GameEventId, Page, PageSize)` | Ranked participant list for a closed event, ordered by `FinalRank`, with prize amounts |
| `GetPlayerEventHistory(PlayerId, SeasonId?, Page, PageSize)` | All game events a player entered (optionally filtered to a season), with rank and prize outcomes |
| `GetEventSeasonLeaderboard(SeasonId, SortBy, Page, PageSize)` | Season-wide event standings; `SortBy` = `event_wins` (default), `events_entered`, `guardian_defences`, `tiles_owned` |
| `GetTerritoryDominanceLeaderboard(SeasonId, TierNumber, Top)` | Live top-N tile owners in a tier, aggregated from `TerritoryTile` (no extra table) |

### New DTOs (`Tycoon.Shared.Contracts/Dtos/EventStatsDtos.cs`)
- `EventLeaderboardEntryDto(PlayerId, FinalRank, AwardedXp, AwardedCoins, EliminatedAt?)`
- `PlayerEventHistoryDto(GameEventId, Kind, FinalRank?, AwardedXp, AwardedCoins, EnteredAt)`
- `EventSeasonLeaderboardEntryDto(PlayerId, EventsWon, EventsTop20, EventsEntered, GuardianDefencesWon, GuardianDaysTotal, CurrentTilesOwned, PeakXpMultiplierBps)`
- `TerritoryDominanceDto(PlayerId, TilesOwned, TotalXpMultiplierBps)`

### New API Endpoints (`GameEventStatsEndpoints`)
```
GET /game-events/{gameEventId}/leaderboard?page&pageSize
GET /game-events/players/{playerId}/event-history?seasonId&page&pageSize   [Authorized]
GET /game-events/season-leaderboard?seasonId&sortBy&page&pageSize
GET /territory/{seasonId}/{tierNumber}/dominance?top
```

### Incremental Hooks Added to Existing Handlers
| Handler | Stats updated |
|---|---|
| `EnterGameEvent` | `EventsEntered++` |
| `CloseGameEventAndDistributePrizes` | `EventsTop20++`, `EventsWon++` (rank 1), `TotalEventXpEarned +=`, `TotalEventCoinsEarned +=` |
| `ResolveGuardianChallenge` (challenger wins) | `GuardianPromotions++` (challenger), `GuardianDefencesLost++` (deposed guardian) |
| `ResolveGuardianChallenge` (guardian wins) | `GuardianDefencesWon++` |
| `ResolveTerritoryDuel` (challenger wins) | `TilesEverCaptured++`, `CurrentTilesOwned` refresh, `PeakXpMultiplierBps` high-water mark |
| `GuardianAssignmentJob` (daily) | `GuardianDaysTotal++` per active guardian (idempotent — only increments when economy txn is newly applied) |

### DI Registration
- `PlayerEventStatsService` registered as `AddScoped` in `Application/DependencyInjection.cs`

---

## [2026-03-15] MinIO Backend Integration

### `IObjectStorage` Abstraction
- Added `Tycoon.Backend.Application/Abstractions/IObjectStorage.cs`
  - `Task PutAsync(string key, Stream content, string contentType, long size = -1, CancellationToken ct)`
  - `string GetPublicUrl(string key)`

### Storage Implementations
- **`MinioObjectStorage`** — Minio SDK v6.0.5, auto-creates bucket on first upload, returns configurable public URL
- **`LocalObjectStorage`** — zero-config fallback writing to `wwwroot/`; used in local dev and tests

### `MinioOptions` POCO
Fields: `Endpoint`, `AccessKey`, `SecretKey`, `Bucket` (default `tycoon-assets`), `UseSSL`, `PublicEndpoint`

### Dependency Injection
- `DependencyInjection.cs` selects implementation at startup:
  - MinIO: when `MinIO:Endpoint` is configured
  - Local: fallback (including in-memory/test branch)

### `AdminMediaEndpoints` Refactor
- Upload handler now injects `IObjectStorage` instead of inlining file-write logic

### Config
- `appsettings.Docker.json` — added `MinIO` section (`minio:9000`, `tycoon-assets`, `PublicEndpoint: localhost:9000`)

### NuGet
- `Directory.Packages.props` — `Minio` v6.0.5
- `Tycoon.Backend.Infrastructure.csproj` — `<PackageReference Include="Minio" />`

### Test
- `AdminMediaTests.Upload_Stores_File_And_Returns_AssetKey_And_Url`
  Chains `/admin/media/intent` → `/admin/media/upload/{assetKey}` multipart POST, asserts `200 OK`, correct `assetKey`, non-empty `url`

---

## [2026-03-15] Realtime File Layout Fix

- Moved `ConnectionRegistry.cs` and `SignalRMatchmakingNotifier.cs` from `Features/Realtime/` → `Realtime/` to match their declared namespace `Tycoon.Backend.Api.Realtime`

---

## [2026-03-15] Vote Feature — SignalR Broadcast

- `VoteCastMessage` shared contract (`Topic`, `Option`, `Counts` dictionary)
- `INotificationClient.VoteCast(VoteCastMessage)` method added
- `NotificationHub.JoinTopic(string topic)` — lets clients subscribe to a topic group (`topic:{topic}`)
- `VoteCastEventHandler` — domain event handler that broadcasts to the topic group on every vote

**Frontend integration:** connect to `/ws/notify`, call `JoinTopic(topic)`, listen for `"VoteCast"` events to update live tallies.

---

## [2026-03-15] Vote Feature — Expanded Options

- Valid vote options extended to: `!A`, `!B`, `!C`, `!D`, `!True`, `!False`
  (supports 3-choice, 4-choice, and true/false poll formats)

---

## [2026-03-15] Vote Feature — Domain, Handlers & API

### Domain
- `Vote` aggregate: `PlayerId`, `Option`, `Topic`, `TimestampUtc`; raises `VoteCastEvent`
- `VoteCastEvent` domain event

### Infrastructure
- `VoteConfiguration`: table `votes`, unique index on `(PlayerId, Topic)`, index on `Topic`
- `AppDb` / `IAppDb`: `DbSet<Vote> Votes`

### Application
- `CastVote` handler: validates option, enforces one-vote-per-player-per-topic, returns `Recorded / DuplicateVote / InvalidOption`
- `GetVoteResults` handler: groups by option, returns counts + percentages ordered by count

### API
| Method | Route | Auth | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/votes` | Required | Cast a vote |
| `GET`  | `/votes/{topic}/results` | Public | Fetch tally |

### Shared Contracts
- `CastVoteRequest`, `CastVoteResponse`, `VoteOptionResult`, `VoteResultsResponse`

> **Note:** run an EF migration to add the `votes` table before deploying.
