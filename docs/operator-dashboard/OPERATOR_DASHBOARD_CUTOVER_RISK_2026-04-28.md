# Operator Dashboard Cutover Risk Assessment — 2026-04-28

> **Target deprecation date:** May 15, 2026
> **Blazor soft-freeze:** April 22, 2026 (already passed — no new Blazor changes)
> **Rollback window:** through June 12, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**Updated: 2026-05-14** — Wave B/C implementation, personalization, player stock overrides, stock bulk reset, migration/seed bootstrap, first operational drilldowns, CI/readiness automation, and evidence-capture templates are complete in Django. The May 15 hard cutover is on track if live evidence is attached. All remaining blockers are operational (parallel-run execution, migrations apply/readiness, sign-off, cutover, rollback-window tracking) rather than code gaps. Use `docs/OPERATOR_DASHBOARD_MAY_CUTOVER_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md` as the closure guide.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with **full cutover on May 15** if the May 14/15 completion guide evidence is populated. Django becomes the sole operator UI after sign-off. Blazor fallback container remains warm through June 12 per the rollback window.

## Feature Gap Matrix

### Covered by Django (cutover safe)

| Surface | Django URL | Backend endpoint | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Health / command center | `/` | `/api/operator/health` | ✅ Live |
| Users triage | `/users` | `/admin/users/*` | ✅ Live — sort, filter, bulk actions, saved views |
| Moderation logs | `/moderation/logs` | `/admin/moderation/*` | ✅ Live — CSV export |
| Security audit | `/audit/security` | `/admin/audit/*` | ✅ Live — CSV export |
| Media intents | `/media/intent` | `/admin/media/*` | ✅ Live |
| MinIO diagnostics | `/minio/diagnostics` | N/A | ✅ Live |
| Flash sales | `/store/flash-sales` | `/admin/store/flash-sales` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-28** |
| Stock policies | `/store/stock-policies` | `/admin/store/stock-policies` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-28** |
| Purchase analytics | `/store/analytics` | `/admin/store/analytics/purchases` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-28** |

### Added in Wave B/C — 2026-04-29 (cutover safe)

| Surface | Django URL | Backend endpoint | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Questions queue | `/content/questions` | `/admin/questions/*` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-29** — list, approve, reject |
| Game events | `/events/game-events` | `/admin/game-events/*` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-29** — list, open, start, close |
| Seasons | `/operations/seasons` | `/admin/seasons/*` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-29** — list, activate, close, recompute, leaderboard |
| Economy player | `/economy/player` | `/admin/economy/*` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-29** — history + coin grant |
| Anti-cheat flags | `/security/anticheat` | `/admin/anti-cheat/*` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-29** — list, review |
| Notifications | `/operations/notifications` | `/admin/notifications/*` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-29** — send, history, dead-letter replay |
| Event queue | `/operations/event-queue` | `/admin/event-queue/*` | ✅ **Added 2026-04-29** — reprocess |

### Post-cutover product backlog (not blocking cutover)

| Surface | Blazor page | Backend endpoint | Risk |
|---------|------------|-----------------|------|
| Reward claim limits | N/A | `/admin/store/reward-limits/*` | LOW — backend exists; dedicated Django UI can follow cutover |
| Near-realtime operator freshness | N/A | polling / future SignalR or SSE | LOW — documented as post-cutover maturity |
| Expanded reporting snapshots | N/A | existing admin APIs plus future aggregates | LOW — product maturity, not parity gate |

## Risks

### R1 — Content team loses Questions workflow on cutover ✅ RESOLVED
Django Questions page is live at `/content/questions` — list, approve, reject. Wave B complete 2026-04-29.

### R2 — Parallel-run sign-off not completed before cutover (OPEN)
The parity checklist requires a full staging parallel-run with real operator accounts before hard cutover. Gate still open as of the May 14 completion guide.

**Mitigation:** Runbook in place at `docs/STAGING_PARALLEL_RUN_RUNBOOK_2026-05-15.md`; evidence and closure rules are in `docs/OPERATOR_DASHBOARD_MAY_CUTOVER_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md`.

### R3 — Economy/reward workflows have no Django UI ✅ RESOLVED
Django Economy page is live at `/economy/player` — player lookup, transaction history, coin grant. Wave C complete 2026-04-29.

### R4 — Permission scopes not in operator role definitions ✅ RESOLVED
`AdminAuthEndpoints.cs` `DefaultPermissions` array updated 2026-04-29 to include all 12 scopes: `users`, `questions`, `events`, `store`, `economy`, `anticheat`, `notifications`, `seasons`, `eventqueue` (read + write each). Operators receive full permissions on next login.

### R5 — Vue project creates confusion about the migration target ✅ RESOLVED
`DEPRECATED.md` added to `Synaptix.OperatorDashboard.Vue` and `Tycoon.OperatorDashboard.Web`. Django is the canonical path.

## Recommended Immediate Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Run `Tycoon.MigrationService` with strict dashboard readiness** in staging and production. Use `docs/pending_migrations_2026-04-29.sql` only as the DBA manual fallback.
2. **Run the read-only cutover readiness workflow** and attach JSON/Markdown artifacts to the evidence pack.
3. **Execute staging parallel-run** using `docs/STAGING_PARALLEL_RUN_RUNBOOK_2026-05-15.md` and capture evidence in `docs/OPERATOR_PARALLEL_RUN_EVIDENCE_2026-04-08.md`.
4. **Collect operator sign-off** — QA Lead, Backend Lead, On-call Operator must sign the runbook's sign-off table before May 15.
5. **Flip nginx upstream on May 15** — switch from Blazor port to Django port. Blazor stays warm through June 12 as the rollback target.
